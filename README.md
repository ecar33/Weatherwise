# Weatherwise

### Project Overview
This project involves developing a command-line interface (CLI) application for consuming a weather API. The application aims to provide users with real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, and more, based on their location or a specified city.

### Chosen Project Idea
The core idea of this project is to create a simple yet effective weather information tool that can be used via the command line. This tool will fetch weather data from a public weather API and present it in an easy-to-read format on the terminal.

### Simplifications and Enhancements
While the project will primarily focus on CLI functionality, the following enhancements and simplifications are planned:

### Enhanced Data Presentation: Improve the way weather data is displayed in the command line, making it more user-friendly and easier to read.

### Location-Based Weather Data: Allow users to input their location (or any location of interest) to fetch weather data specific to that area.

### Weather Trends: Implement functionality to show short-term weather trends, like the forecast for the next few hours or days.

### Caching Mechanism: To enhance performance, implement a caching mechanism that temporarily stores recent weather data, reducing the frequency of API calls.

### Error Handling Improvements: Enhance error handling to gracefully manage situations like API downtime, invalid user inputs, or network issues.

###CLI-Based: The application will be purely command-line based, without a graphical user interface (GUI), to keep the focus on backend functionality and simplify the development process.

Limited to Basic Weather Data: Initially, the application will limit its scope to basic weather parameters to keep the API consumption and data processing straightforward.
